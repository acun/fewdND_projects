## :books: fewdND_projects 

Projects from Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program are going to be uploaded here.


### :notebook: How to Run the Projects

- Download as .zip
- Extract the folder with your favorite archiver (7-Zip, WinRAR..)
- Open the .html file with your browser (double clicking usually automatically opens the .html in your browser)


### :notebook: Things to Consider

- The .html and .css files must be inside the **same** folder (or on the same directory) in order for the .html file to display the styling(that lives inside the .css) properly.
