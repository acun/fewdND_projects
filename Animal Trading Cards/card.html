			<p class="description">Giraffes are the tallest land animals. You might think watching out for lions and spending 16 to 20 hours a day eating would all weigh heavily on a giraffe. Surprisingly enough, giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They
				often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time. Many people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of sounds, including moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just very rarely do so. Giraffes
				are often the early warning signal for other savanna animals: if a giraffe herd starts to run, everyone else does, too!
